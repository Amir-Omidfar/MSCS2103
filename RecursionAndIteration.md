# Iteration types:
1. For loops:
2. While and do-while loops
# Recursion: 
1. Base Case​: Case that is solved directly​. 
    1. Prevents infinite looping​
2. Recursive Case​: Case that is solved if we know the solution to a smaller problem

## Pros of Recursion:
1. More elegant code​
2. More “provable” or reliable code since the code often closely matches its definition​
## Cons of Recursion:
1. Possibly slower code​
2. Sometimes difficult to trace through an execution​
3. Many people do not understand how it works

## Recursion Vs Iteration:
- With simple examples iteration seems easier and more logical​
- However, with more complex and scientific uses, recursion is the best choice in most cases​
- Artificial intelligence, scientific computing, complex game programming
- In general they both perform the same kinds of tasks: solve a complicated task one piece at a time and combine the results​
- Emphasis of iteration: keep repeating until task is “done”​
- Emphasis of recursion: solve a large problem by breaking it up into smaller and smaller pieces until you can solve it; combine the results​
