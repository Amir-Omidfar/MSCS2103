In two pages please provide a summary of the article,
including describing what a transistor is 
and the three major categories (conductors, insulators, semiconductors.)
In addition, please discuss three key points 
which stood out to you and explain why?


transistor and its 3 types

3 points that stood out to you 
One of the most importat inventions of 20th century
originally to amplify sound over phone lines and replace vacuum tubes
Physicists and engineers began to incorporate transistors into various 
electronic devices and they got smaller and more efficient.

By attaching two transistors they made the first IC in 1958 which led to 
microprocessor.
By the 1960s, computer scientist (and Intel co-founder) Gordon Moore made an interesting observation: 
He noticed that every 12 months (the pace changed thoughout the time and now is
every 24 months).But the size has gone from cm to nanometer --> 32nm
We might be bumping against some fundamental phyiscs law in transistor size
